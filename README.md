Decision Trees and Random Forests – Heart Disease Prediction
📌 Objective

The objective of this project is to understand and implement tree-based machine learning models for classification using the Heart Disease Dataset (UCI).
The project focuses on:

Training and visualizing a Decision Tree Classifier

Understanding and controlling overfitting

Training a Random Forest Classifier and comparing performance

Interpreting feature importance

Evaluating models using cross-validation


Heart Disease Dataset (UCI)

Contains patient medical attributes with a binary target variable

Target:

0 → No Heart Disease

1 → Presence of Heart Disease

Key features include:

age

sex

cp (chest pain type)

chol
